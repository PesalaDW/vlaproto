A simple VLA simulation.

🚀 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Mini Project
🧠 Problem Definition
This project explores a simplified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) task that integrates computer vision, natural language understanding, and robotic control. The goal is to create a system that can interpret a visual scene and a natural language instruction, then execute a corresponding physical action in simulation.

🎯 Objective
Build a virtual pick-and-place system where:

The visual input is an image of a tabletop scene

The language input is a natural command (e.g., “Place the red block on the green one”)

The system output is an interpreted action, simulated using PyBullet

📦 Motivation
While many large-scale VLA models exist (e.g., Ego4D, RT-2), there’s a gap in lightweight, task-specific, fully virtual VLA pipelines designed for educational prototyping and experimentation. This project bridges that gap using:

Vision: Pre-trained encoders (e.g., CLIP, BLIP-2)

Language: Natural instructions

Action: Simulated robot using PyBullet

🧪 Example
Input	
Image	Scene with red, blue, green cubes
Text	“Move the red cube to the top of the green one.”
Output	PyBullet sim of red cube being picked and placed on green

🔍 Scope
Prototype-level: small dataset, few objects

Fully virtual (no real hardware)

Expandable to egocentric views, multi-step actions, or video inputs

📎 Dependencies
Python 3.10+

PyBullet

OpenCV

Transformers (HuggingFace)

CLIP or BLIP2 (for vision-language embedding)

# Mini Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System: Virtual Robotics in PyBullet

This project is a minimal working prototype of a fully virtual Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model. The agent is able to perceive a virtual scene, understand a natural language instruction, and carry out a physical action in simulation.

## 💡 Features
- PyBullet-based 3D simulation
- Visual input (RGB camera feed)
- Natural language input (e.g., “Pick up the red cube”)
- Simple multimodal embedding fusion
- Action generation and execution

## 🧠 Architecture
- Visual Encoder: CLIP Vision or ResNet
- Language Encoder: CLIP Text or BERT
- Fusion: MLP or Transformer
- Action Decoder: MLP → Joint commands
- Simulator: PyBullet (robot + scene)

## 🚀 Getting Started
